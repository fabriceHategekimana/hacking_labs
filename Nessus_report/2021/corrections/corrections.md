# Possible Solution

- Describe a maximum of 3 different actions (which are unintended by MEGACORP) an attacker could perform by exploiting the critical vulnerability on the Exchange Server (Mars)?
	- An attacker can read the contents of all mailboxes
	- An attacker can write files to the file system of the Exchange Server (WebShell)
	- An attacker can execute commands as LocalSystem and Exchange Trusted Subsystem and thus e.g., changing Exchange configuration, exporting mailbox etc.
	- An attacker can use the Exchange Server as a jump host for further attacks against the complete network
- Describe a maximum of 3 different actions (which are unintended by MEGACORP) an attacker could perform by exploiting the critical vulnerability on the Domain Controller (Pluto)?
	- An attacker can change / remove a service account on the Domain Controller (and thus gaining control over the DC)
	- An attacker can harvest credentials (and then execute attacks such as golden ticket, pass-the-hash or silver ticket attack)
	- An attacker can download malware (if internet is routed in the network ïƒ  see question 3) and distribute it laterally
- Under what technical circumstances the critical vulnerability on the Domain Controller (Pluto) is most problematic?
	- Routed internet in server network
	- Accepted inbound-connections from untrusted zones (on DC)
	- Misconfigured Firewall / Router
	- ...
- List a maximum of 2 different immediate actions be taken in the given scenario.
	- Patching the vulnerable systems (Mars & Pluto)
	- Checking whether the vulnerabilities already have been exploited and changes has been made to systems
	- Disconnect the DC immediately from internet (in case of an active route)
	- ...
- List a maximum of 3 different mid- or long-term actions be taken in the given scenario.
	- Ensure regular patching through respective management processes
	- Ensure regular security audits
	- Server hardening
	- Implement a Reverse Proxy / Web Application Firewall
	- Implement sensors such as NIDS, NIDS
	- ...
- Select an existing vulnerability of the "High" or "Medium" category on Mars and briefly describe how the chosen vulnerability can be closed.
	- Correct solution depends on the candidate's selected vulnerability and has to be assessed by the correction experts.
