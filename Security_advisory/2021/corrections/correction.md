# Possible Solution  
  
## Relevance  
  
### Kind of affected systems  
Desktop, end user systems with Windows OS. Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App and Cisco Webex Productivity Tools releases earlier than releases 40.6 and 40.10  
  
### Placement  
Accessability of end user systems, internet uplink  
  
### Authentication  
Strength of authentication mechanisms  
  
### Usecases  
Employees who work from a shared computer, stay logged into their computers and use WebEx  
  
## Threats  
### Authentication strength  
Single factor authentication combined with weak password policies (length, complexity) so that an attacker can easily gain access  
  
### User awareness  
Bad awareness and behavior of end users leading to login possibilities for attackers  
  
### Credential management  
Weak credential management, an attacker becomes aware of valid credentials of a Windows end-user system, e.g. password leaks  
  
### Malware  
Virus auto-running on other userâ€™s profile, process starting a session as a different user  
  
## Risks  
### Potential damage  
Identity theft, information theft, information disclosure  
  
### Probability estimation  
Low as an attacker must have valid credentials on the end-user system  
  
### Criticality  
CVSS Score (5.5) recognized and correct level (Medium)  
  
### Criticality  
Recommendation timeframe for software update  
  
## Countermeasures  
- Deploy software update  
- Implement strong authentication  
- Perform user awareness training  
- Disallow access by clients with versions not containing the fix  
- Inform all employees with WebEx accounts and ask them to upgrade their installation
