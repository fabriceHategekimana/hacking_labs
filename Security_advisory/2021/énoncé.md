## Introduction

A security analyst of an investment bank gets a security advisory forwarded, containing vulnerability information about the corporate collaboration solution. Due to an ongoing pandemic, it is crucial for the bank to stay in touch with their customers. As all staff are obliged to work from home, video conferencing and collaboration features are heavily used now, even by those employees who were sceptical about online collaboration before or are (still) not experienced with it. The security analyst’s line manager wants to know if the company should be concerned, and if so, what has to be done to avoid a negative impact on the company's services. The security analyst is asked to perform an analysis of the advisory.
Goals and Tasks

Perform an analysis of the given security advisory and report your findings containing the following information:

- Relevance of the advisory for the company – kind of affected systems and influence factors
- Given threats - scenarios that (may) trigger an exploit [maximum of 3]
- Risk evaluation – potential damage, probability estimate and criticality for the company
- Recommended countermeasures – action and type (technical, organizational, …) [maximum of 3]

## Submission

Submit a written report as a PDF document, containing the information structured as outlined in the goal and tasks section.
